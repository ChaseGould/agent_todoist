- Add requirements file or is there a way to make my project install all of the necessary python packages?
- Script to delete all tasks under a project. useful after I've made my summary
- Need to be able to run these scripts from my phone. Maybe pythonista.
- Script to push my summary to my phone so it's easy copy into any.do. could be an email or push to todoist.
- Read api keys from a file so its not in source code.
